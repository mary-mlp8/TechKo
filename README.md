# 🌱 TechKo – Intelligent Coffee Farming Platform

TechKo is a regenerative agri-tech prototype designed for mountain coffee growers in Brazil. It simulates how technology could assist small producers in monitoring their farms and reusing coffee pulp post-harvest through an intuitive, visual, and modular dashboard.

---

## ☕ What is TechKo?

**TechKo** is a visual dashboard for simulating the benefits of digital and regenerative coffee farming.

It is built to empower rural producers with accessible technology that:

- Simulates environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, plagues)
- Simulates post-harvest compost automation
- Shows progress via alerts, compost visuals, and IA-style recommendations
- Uses realistic profiles of coffee producers (like João Ribeiro da Silva)

---

## 🎯 Core Modules

### 1. Coffee Guardian – Simulated Monitoring

- Dashboard shows simplified data from simulated sensors
- Includes color-coded alerts and recommendations (ex: irrigation, ventilation)
- Uses friendly language like a “campesino AI assistant”

### 2. BioCompBot – Regenerative Automation

- Simulates compost generation from discarded coffee pulp
- Shows compost process over time: temperature, humidity, etc.
- Output: natural compost to re-fertilize the coffee plants

## 🧪 Simulated Impact (Numerical)

> “A coffee field of 1 hectare produces ~200 kg of pulp per harvest.  
> With TechKo, this pulp can turn into up to 50 kg of compost – enough to fertilize 100 coffee plants naturally.”

This gives judges and users a tangible idea of the platform's potential.

## 🚀 Roadmap – Scalable in Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fase 1 (now) | Dashboard + Simulated logic |
| Fase 2 | Integration of real low-cost sensors (DHT22, Arduino, LoRa/Wi-Fi) |
| Fase 3 | Autonomous compost hardware built from recycled parts |
| Fase 4 | Offline-first version for rural zones without connectivity |

This structure makes TechKo both feasible and inspiring for rural cooperatives.

## 💸 Economic Viability (Estimated)

TechKo combines regenerative technology, freemium access, and responsible funding to scale sustainable solutions in mountain coffee farms — without losing control, quality, or purpose.

Three Complementary Revenue Streams:

1. B2B2C Model – Coffee brands funding regeneration

Coffee brands sponsor the use of TechKo across their allied farms as part of their sustainability, traceability, and regeneration commitments.
In return, they receive:
● “Powered by TechKo” visual certifi cation
● Access to traceable environmental impact data
● Real farm stories for purpose-driven brand storytelling

What’s included: platform + physical kit + regenerative monitoring system

2. Sales of Low-Cost TechKo Kits
   
What’s included: sensors + composting unit + app access
Estimated price: to be confi rmed after Phase 2 of the roadmap
The feasibility of self-assembled kits with recycled parts will be evaluated through local partnerships, provided minimum operational standards are met.

3. Licensing / Subscription for Cooperatives
Access to a community dashboard with:
● Group-level data visualization
● Cross-farm benchmarking
● Technical support & assistance with regenerative practices

Model: Monthly subscription scaled by number of farms

Freemium Access for Individual Farmers
● Free access to basic environmental visualization
● Digital composting guide

## 📊 Before & After Summary

| Aspect        | Before (no TechKo)      | After (with TechKo)               |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Monitoring     | Manual / Visual only      | Alerts + simple smart assistant    |
| Waste usage    | Pulp discarded            | Turned into compost                |
| Resilience     | Exposed to climate loss   | Mitigated via timely actions       |
| Fertilization  | Expensive chemical input  | Local compost from coffee pulp     |

## 🧭 Vision & Emotion

> “Now the coffee cares for the field.  
> And for the hands that make it grow.”

TechKo is more than a prototype — it’s a message of hope and regeneration.
